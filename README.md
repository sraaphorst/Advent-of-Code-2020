# Advent of Code 2020

An attempt for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

* Probably all written in Kotlin. My Kotlin is a bit rusty so earlier days may not be as clean as they could be.
* Note that this is incomplete, and will likely not be completed: it was just for some Kotlin practice and fun exercises.
